When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when I want to collaborate with other people.
2. when I use different computers on the project.
3. when I want a backup copy of my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository is supposed to be the master that other collaborators want to work off of. Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote might incorporate changes I or my collaborators don't want to share.
