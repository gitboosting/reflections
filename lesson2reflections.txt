What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git directory to store meta data required for revision tracking. We need to do it so we can add files to the repository to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that can be commited. The working directory contains all files. The staging area allows one to select what files should be committed in one go.
